Data Mining Anomoly Detection Models

Overview:

Welcome to our machine learning project! In this repository, we aim to develop an anomaly detection framework using autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The primary objective is to detect anomalies in a dataset by training models on normal data and identifying deviations from the learned patterns.

Project Structure:

data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing our models. Ensure that your dataset is stored here.

Usage:

Data Preparation: Start by preparing your dataset. Ensure that your dataset is stored in the data/ directory. Perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization, or feature engineering.
Model Training: Explore the scripts in the models/ directory to build and train machine learning models. Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies to achieve the best performance. Consider using techniques like autoencoders and GANs for anomaly detection.
Model Evaluation: After training your models, evaluate their performance using the provided evaluation metrics. Visualize the results and analyze how well the models perform on the test data. You can use various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize your models by tuning hyperparameters. Techniques such as grid search or random search can help you find the best combination of hyperparameters for your models. Experiment with different values for learning rates, batch sizes, regularization techniques, and model architectures.
